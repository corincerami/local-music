Fairmont is a band on an indie record label, Mint 400, in northern New Jersey. They are hosting a show next Friday at a warehouse they've rented out in Nutley, NJ. They want to alert people in the surrounding towns to the show. They create a profile for their band on the site, along with photos and links to their Soundcloud, iTunes, etc so people can check out their music. They then create a new event page for the show with the data, time, location, and other important details (BYOB?, other artists performing, price, etc).

I am a twenty-something who has recently moved to Boston and I'm still not very familiar with the local music scene. I decide to go on the site to find bands that are performing nearby soon. I find a show happening this weekend in a nearby neighborhood and check out the bands that will be playing. They seem cool and I RSVP to the show. The morning of the show I get an email (or text?) to remind me that it's happening.

I'm going to a punk show this Sunday but I don't know anyone else who wants to go. I RSVP to the show on the site and check out who else is going. I find a few people who have pretty similar taste to me and seem cool. I send them friend requests and send each of them a message asking if they'd like to meet up for the show. A few of us agree to meet at a bar near the venue for drinks beforehand and then head to the show together.
